# regtools

Tools that integrate DNA-seq and RNA-seq data to help interpret mutations
in a regulatory and splicing context.

## Features

- Identify evidence for aberrant splicing in RNA reads near a list of variants.
- Extract exon-exon junctions from a RNAseq BAM file.
- Annotate exon-exon junctions with information from a known transcriptome.
- Annotate variants with splice-region(the definition of this region is configurable) annotations.

## Installation

Clone and install regtools by running the following:
```
    git clone https://github.com/griffithlab/regtools
    cd regtools/
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make
```

For convienience we also maintain a docker image available at [https://hub.docker.com/r/griffithlab/regtools/](https://hub.docker.com/r/griffithlab/regtools/)

## Usage:

```
    regtools --help
```
